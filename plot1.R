# This code plots the histogram of Global Active Power. It opens the data file
# "household_power_consumption.txt" and loads the data of February 1st and 2nd, 2007,
# of the variable "Global_active_power". The output is the histogram of this
# variable as a PNG file named "plot1.png".
#
# The "plot1.R" must be placed in the same folder where the data file is. The PNG file
# will be output in the same folder.

## It reads the data from the dataset file. It skips the rows up to February 1st.
## Then, it loads only the next couple of days of data. It's necessary to name the
## variables again due to the skipping parameter.

## It plots the histogram with red bards.

## It saves the current device to the file "plot1.png".
